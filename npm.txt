NPM is a package manager for JavaScript.
It helps in managing dependencies and packages in a Node.jsproject.


Simplifies the process of including third-party libraries and tools in your project.
Ensures that all team members are using the same versions of dependencies.


NPM comes bundled with Node.js, so installing Node.js also installs NPM.
One can check the version of NPM installed using the command npm -v.


You can install packages using the command npm install <package-name>.
Packages can be installed globally or locally to a project.


package.json file contains metadata about the project, lists the dependencies and scripts.
It is created using the command npm init.


npm install: Installs all dependencies listed in package.json.
npm update: Updates all packages to their latest versions.
npm uninstall <package-name>: Removes a package from the project.
The difference between "dependencies" and "devDependencies" in package.json is"dependencies" 
are needed for both development and production, while "devDependencies" are needed only in development.
npm install <package> --save-dev command is used to install a package as a dev dependency.


One can define custom scripts in the package.jsonfile to automate tasks.
Scripts section of package.jsonis used to specify the scripts to run commands.
For example, "start": "node app.js" can be used to start the application.


The purpose of nodemon in a Node.js application is to automatically restart the server when file changes are detected.
The command used to install nodemon globally is npm install -g nodemon.
The command used to install nodemon locally is npm install nodemon.
